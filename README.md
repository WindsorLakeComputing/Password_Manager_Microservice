# Password Manager Microservice

Password manager microservice is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to create and store passwords, encrypted, using a password manager microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend](/password-manager-frontend)
A basic React client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 
2. [The RestAPI Feed Backend](/password-manager-restapi-password), a Node-Express feed microservice.
3. [The RestAPI User Backend](/password-manager-restapi-user), a Node-Express user microservice.


## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with the RestAPI backends). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman, and then the frontend should integrate.

### Installing Node and NPM
This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (NPM is included) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the root of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:
```bash
npm install
```
>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

### Setup Backend Node Environment
You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:
1. Initialize a new project: `npm init`
2. Install express: `npm i express --save`
3. Install typescript dependencies: `npm i ts-node-dev tslint typescript  @types/bluebird @types/express @types/node --save-dev`
4. Look at the `package.json` file from the RestAPI repo and copy the `scripts` block into the auto-generated `package.json` in this project. This will allow you to use shorthand commands like `npm run dev`


### Configure The Backend Endpoint
Ionic uses enviornment files located in `./src/enviornments/enviornment.*.ts` to load configuration variables at runtime. By default `environment.ts` is used for development and `enviornment.prod.ts` is used for produciton. The `apiHost` variable should be set to your server url either locally or in the cloud.


### Building the Static Frontend Files
Ionic CLI can build the frontend into static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files. These files can be uploaded to a host to be consumed by users on the web. Build artifacts are located in `./www`. To build from source, open terminal and run:
```bash
ionic build
```
